**Stepping** out of one’s comfort zone is often easier said than done. It requires courage, willingness to embrace new challenges, and an openness to change. Recently, I had the incredible opportunity to attend the UBS-sponsored talent development program called JUMP, an experience that was nothing short of transformative. The program brought together a diverse group of individuals from across the APAC region, including Japan, Singapore, and India, with the shared goal of honing our leadership, networking, and teamwork skills. My team comprised 11 highly talented professionals, and together, we embarked on a journey of personal and professional growth under the expert guidance of Ralph Hubacher, one of the best trainers I have ever met.

### Breaking the Ice: The First Step to Connection

The program commenced with an essential lesson in communication—how to initiate conversations with strangers and build meaningful connections. Many of us struggle with breaking the ice in unfamiliar settings, whether it’s at networking events, conferences, or within our own organizations. The first day was dedicated to equipping us with techniques to engage in conversations confidently, making them feel natural and comfortable.

Through interactive exercises we learned the importance of active listening, maintaining open body language, and using open-ended questions to keep discussions flowing. What stood out was the realization that most people appreciate when someone takes the initiative to talk to them. This simple yet profound lesson set the stage for the rest of the program, emphasizing the importance of communication in personal and professional success.

### High-Performance Team Building: Learning from the Best

The second day was all about understanding the dynamics of high-performance teams. To bring this concept to life, we had the incredible privilege of meeting Jamling Norgay, the famous mountaineer and son of Tenzing Norgay, who was part of the first successful expedition to Mount Everest.

Jamling’s session was nothing short of inspiring. He shared gripping stories from his own mountaineering experiences, drawing powerful parallels between teamwork in extreme conditions and the corporate world. Climbing a mountain requires absolute trust in one’s team, clear communication, and a shared vision—values that are just as critical in any organizational setting. His insights highlighted the necessity of collaboration, resilience, and adaptability in achieving collective success. The stories of perseverance and unity resonated deeply with all of us, reinforcing the idea that the strength of a team lies in its ability to support and uplift one another.

### Leadership and Panel Discussion: Insights from the Top

The third day was dedicated to leadership — what it truly means to lead and how to cultivate the qualities of an effective leader. This session went beyond textbook theories, providing us with real-world insights from some of the most experienced leaders at UBS. We had the privilege of engaging in a panel discussion with three senior UBS leaders, who shared their journeys, challenges, and the invaluable lessons they learned along the way.

One of the key takeaways from this discussion was the importance of adaptability in leadership. In today’s rapidly evolving world, a great leader is not just someone who provides direction but also someone who listens, learns, and adjusts strategies to align with changing circumstances. Another crucial aspect emphasized was the ability to motivate teams toward a common goal. Leaders who inspire and empower their teams are the ones who drive meaningful change and foster a culture of growth and innovation.

As the third day came to a close, we had the opportunity to unwind and celebrate our diverse backgrounds with a traditional dress dinner and dance. It was a beautiful evening filled with laughter, music, and an appreciation for different cultures. This event was not just about fun; it was a testament to the program’s emphasis on inclusivity and the value of cultural exchange. Sharing meals, stories, and dance moves brought us even closer, reinforcing the sense of camaraderie that had been building throughout the program.

### Design Thinking and Idea Pitching: A Grand Finale

The final day of the program focused on one of the most critical skills in today’s corporate world—design thinking and the art of pitching ideas effectively. In a world driven by innovation, the ability to approach problems creatively and present solutions convincingly is invaluable.

We were introduced to the concept of design thinking, a problem-solving methodology that encourages empathy, ideation, prototyping, and testing. Through hands-on exercises, we explored real-world challenges and worked collaboratively to devise innovative solutions. This approach not only broadened our perspectives but also reinforced the significance of user-centric thinking in business.

### Reflections and Takeaways

As the JUMP program came to an end, I found myself reflecting on the incredible journey we had embarked upon. It was more than just a training program—it was a transformative experience that challenged us, inspired us, and equipped us with the skills necessary to excel in our careers and beyond.

The biggest lesson I took away from JUMP was the power of stepping out of one’s comfort zone. Growth happens when we push our boundaries, embrace discomfort, and take on new challenges with an open mind. The program reinforced the importance of networking, collaboration, leadership, and innovation—all crucial elements for success in today’s world.

Moreover, the bonds we formed with our fellow participants were truly special. Coming from different backgrounds and cultures, we learned from each other’s experiences, perspectives, and strengths. The friendships built during this program will undoubtedly continue to flourish, serving as a strong professional network in the years to come.


The UBS JUMP talent development program was a remarkable journey of self-discovery and learning. From mastering the art of conversation and understanding the essence of teamwork to developing leadership skills and presenting ideas with confidence, every aspect of the program contributed to our growth. The experience left an indelible mark, not only in terms of the skills acquired but also in the memories created and the connections forged.

As I move forward in my career, I carry with me the lessons learned and the confidence gained from this incredible program. To anyone who has the opportunity to participate in JUMP or a similar initiative, I wholeheartedly encourage you to embrace it. Stepping out of your comfort zone may be daunting, but it is where true growth begins. And as we learned from Jamling Norgay, whether in climbing mountains or in our professional journeys, success is always a team effort.
